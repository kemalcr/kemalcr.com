>Kemal is a Fast, Effective, Simple web framework for [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/).

Hello everyone,

Kemal 1.9.0 is here :tada: This release brings Crystal 1.19.0 support along with important security improvements and performance optimizations :rocket:

## Crystal 1.19.0 Support :gem:

Kemal now fully supports Crystal 1.19.0, keeping up with the latest Crystal release. You can now enjoy all the new features and improvements that Crystal 1.19.0 brings to the table :heart:

## Security Enhancement :shield:

This release includes an important security update that **limits the maximum request body size** to prevent DoS (Denial of Service) attacks. This protection ensures your Kemal applications are more resilient against malicious requests attempting to overwhelm your server with large payloads.

By default, Kemal now enforces sensible limits on incoming request body sizes, making your applications more secure out of the box :lock:

## Performance Optimization :zap:

We've optimized JSON parameter parsing by directly using the request body IO instead of reading it into memory first. This improvement reduces memory allocations and speeds up JSON request handling, making your API endpoints even faster :fire:
