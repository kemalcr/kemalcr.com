## Quick Start

require "kemal"

get "/" do
  "Hello World!"
end

Kemal.run
```

## Key Features

- **High-performance by default**: Built on Crystal with a thin abstraction layer so you can serve a large number of requests with low latency and low memory footprint.
- **Full REST & HTTP support**: Handle all HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc.) with a straightforward routing DSL.
- **WebSocket & real-time**: First-class WebSocket support for building chats, dashboards and other real-time experiences.
- **JSON-first APIs**: Native JSON handling makes building JSON APIs and microservices feel natural.
- **Static assets made easy**: Serve static files (assets, uploads, SPA bundles) efficiently from the same application.
- **Template engine included**: Built-in ECR template engine for server‑rendered HTML when you need it.
- **Composable middleware**: Flexible middleware system to add logging, auth, rate limiting, metrics and more.
- **Ergonomic request/response API**: Simple access to params, headers, cookies and bodies via a clear context object.
- **Session management**: Easy session handling with kemal-session, suitable for production apps.
- **Production Ready** - Battle-tested and used in production by many companies
